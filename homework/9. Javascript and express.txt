Create REST api with Express and Js For Movie and Actor management.
The api should store data in memory.

for simplicity lets say actor can be involved in just a single movie.

1. Actor can have FirstName, LastName and DateOfBirth
2. Date of birth cannot be in future.
3. Movie can have title, creationDate and a single actor associated. Actor Id has to be supplied.
4. When creating movie, if actor id is not supplied, 400 has to be returned. If Actor does not exist, 404 must be returned.
5. Create CRUD for Movies and Actors.
