You should have an express api for actors and movies, and Postman collection.

1. Please finish these above if you havent, try understanding the code behind.
2. We had some basics in Postman testing. See if you can add these automatical 'equal' checks to your postman requests.
Keep in mind that these checks should be rerunnable.


const responseJson = pm.response.json()

pm.collectionVariables.set("actorId", responseJson.id)

// Check that first_name is jaunius and last_name is pinelis
pm.test("Check that first and last names are correct", function () {
     var responseObject = pm.response.json();

     pm.expect(responseObject).to.be.an('object');
     pm.expect(responseObject.first_name).to.eq("Jaunius");
     pm.expect(responseObject.last_name).to.eq('Pinelis');
});
