https://github.com/JauniusPinelis/cypress-pipelines/blob/main/.github/workflows/node.js.yml

1. Please check that previous homework is fully covered with automated tests, commands, describes, variables and etc.
2. Try adding Github actions which would run your cypress tests automatically whenever you update Main branch.
