Practice some basics of SQL in your new local Postgre Server.

1. Connect to your local POstgre Server with pgadmin4
using host 'localhost' with user 'postgres' and password 'postgres'
2. Create a new database for 'shop_database'
3. Create tables for shop and shop_item.
Shop should have name, address, and post-code
ShopItem should have name, quantity, Price.
4. Enter 4 records into each table.
5. Write a query to get all shop_items
which quantity multiplies by price is under 20

Advanced, Optional:
1. Each table should have generated primary key.
2. Shop and Shop_item should be connected by foreign key constraint.
3. Do we need an index here?



CREATE TABLE cars (
  brand VARCHAR(255),
  model VARCHAR(255),
  year INT
);

select * from cars

insert into cars (brand, model, year)
values ('Peugeot', '406', '1999')

select * from cars
where year < 2000
