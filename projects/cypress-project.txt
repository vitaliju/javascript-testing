We have many test cases in https://www.automationexercise.com/test_cases
So pickup 8 of those test cases and implement them with Cypress.

Requirements:
1. Fresh public git repo with .gitignore and Readme. Assume this is going to be a portfolio project.
2. Logical commit history.
3. Clean code, naming convetions and test descriptions.
4. Code structure: i want the test to be at least in 2 different files. 
I want logical test structure with describe()
5. Github action which runs tests automatically when main branch is updated.
'main' should be the main branch
6. Cypress commands are being used.
7. No unneeded files.
8. You will have to explain the code you have written.


Readme should be nicely formatted and contain:
0. What are we testing and what is this about?
1. Requirements
2. How to install
3. How to run tests
4. Any issues with tests or website?
