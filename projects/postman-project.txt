You have an api documentation for Api testing in 
https://www.automationexercise.com/api_list

Please pick 7 test cases and implement that in Postman.

It looks like instead of json, this api accepts form-data.

Requirements:
1. Your TEST suite should have at least of 1 GET,  1 POST,  1 Delete
2. Each test should have a check for status and at least one assertion for response body.
3. You cannot make assertions for whole data, because it may change, 
    but you can make checks that the format would not change.
4. Make the best decision what you can test. 

5. This should be a new repo which contains Postman collections 
and allows the tests to be ran with newman.
6. The tests should be re-runnable.
7. Please add pipeline
